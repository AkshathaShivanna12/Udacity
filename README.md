Repository where I collect all the assignments for the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree.

## Projects

### Statistics [repo](https://github.com/jlcoto/Udacity/tree/master/statistics)

• Analyzed the Stroop effect using descriptive statistics to provide an intuition about the data, and inferential statistics to draw a conclusion based on the results.
Skills: Python, IPython, Pandas.

### Exploratory Analysis with Pandas [repo](https://github.com/jlcoto/Udacity/tree/master/pandas_wrangling)

### Data gathering and wrangling with SQL and Pandas [repo](https://github.com/jlcoto/Udacity/tree/master/data_wrangling)
• Parsed 140 Mb XML document to obtain relevant data.
• Cleaned, audited and corrected more than 2500 registries.
• Stored cleaned data in a SQL database, performed queries and generated plots. Created map plots to inspect georeferenced data.
Skills: Python, SQL, XML parsing, regular expressions, Pandas, BaseMap, GeoPandas.

### Exploratory Analysis with R [repo](https://github.com/jlcoto/Udacity/tree/master/earthquake_project)

• Cleaned, merged and analyzed data on consequences of earthquake in the world from the 1900s.
• Created a notebook with clear steps for getting, cleaning and merging the data from different sources. Created a codebook with all the variables included in final dataset.
• Created more than 20 visualizations to understand the data. Analyzed the conditional relationships of deaths of earthquakes given its magnitude and regime type/gdp per capita.
Skills: R, R Studio, ggplot, Python, pandas, GeoPandas.

### Machine Learning - Enron Case [repo](https://github.com/jlcoto/Udacity/tree/master/machine_learning_project)

• Identified which Enron employees are more likely to have committed fraud using machine learning and public Enron financial and email data.
• Trained and tested different algorithms and used feature selection techniques.
• Tunned algorithms’ parameters to improve original results. 
Skills: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, machine learning. 

### Data visualization - Earthquake project [repo](https://github.com/jlcoto/Udacity/tree/master/earthquake_visualization)

• Developed visualization where users can fully interact with geographical and temporal features of earthquakes.
• Successfully integrated D3.js and Leaflet to produce animations and transitions.
• Project featured by Data Science Weekly.
Skills: D3.js, Leaflet, GeoPandas, Pandas, Python.

### A/B testing [repo](https://github.com/jlcoto/Udacity/tree/master/a_b_testing)

• Designed an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. I also analyzed the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity, recommended a decision, and proposed a follow-up experiment.
Skills: Pandas, IPython.
