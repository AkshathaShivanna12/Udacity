Database description (obtained from webpage)
The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.

FLAG_TSUNAMI:
 When a tsunami was generated by an earthquake, "Tsu" appears in the Assoc Tsu column. There should also be a "TSU" link in the Assoc column which is linked to the tsunami event database. The TSU link will display additional tsunami event information in a new browser window.

The event coordinates of approximately 100 earthquakes in this database are not known and the latitude and longitude are listed as 0.0. Therefore, to retrieve all the events from a particular country or state, leave the event coordinates search parameter blank and enter the
country.

LONGITUDE:
Valid values: -180 to +180 Longitude: 0 to 180
(Eastern Hemisphere) -180 to 0 (Western Hemisphere) 
Events prior to 1900 were not instrumentally located, therefore, the location given is based on the latitude and longitude of the city where the damage occurred.
 
The event coordinates of approximately 100 earthquakes in this database are not known and the latitude and longitude are listed as 0.0. Therefore, to retrieve all the events from a particular country or state, leave the event coordinates search parameter blank and enter the
country.

FOCAL_DEPTH
Valid values: 0 to 700 km The
depth of the earthquake is given in kilometers.

MAGNITUDES
The magnitude is a measure of seismic energy. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirtyfold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Each increase in magnitude of one unit is equivalent to an increase of seismic energy of about
1.6 x 10,000,000,000,000 ergs. 

'EQ_MAG_MS'
Valid values: 0.0 to9.9
The Ms magnitude is the surface-wave magnitude of the earthquake.


'EQ_MAG_MW'
Mw Magnitude:  Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9
The Mw magnitude is based on the moment magnitude scale. Moment is a physical quantity proportional to the slip on the fault times the area of the fault surface that slips; it is related to the total energy released in the EQ. The moment can be estimated from seismograms (and also from geodetic measurements). The moment is then converted into a number similar to other earthquake magnitudes by a standard formula. The result is called the moment magnitude. The moment magnitude provides an estimate of earthquake size that is valid over the complete range of magnitudes, a characteristic that was lacking in other magnitude scales.

'EQ_MAG_MB’:
Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9
The Mb magnitude is the compressional body wave (P-wave) magnitude.

'EQ_MAG_ML'
Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9
The ML magnitude was the original magnitude relationship defined by Richter and Gutenberg for local earthquakes in 1935. It is based on the maximum amplitude of a seismogram recorded on a Wood-Anderson torsion seismograph. Although these instruments are no longer widely in use, ML values are calculated using modern instrumentation with appropriate adjustments.

'EQ_MAG_MFA'
Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9
The Mfa magnitudes are computed from the felt area, for earthquakes that occurred before seismic instruments were in general use. 

'EQ_MAG_UNK'
Valid values: 0.0 to 9.9
The computational method for the earthquake magnitude was unknown and could not be determined from the published sources.

POLITY2 Combined Polity Score: The POLITY score is computed by subtracting the AUTOC score from the
DEMOC score; the resulting unified polity scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic). This variable is a modified version of the POLITY variable added
in order to facilitate the use of the POLITY regime measure in time-series analyses. It modifies the
combined annual POLITY score by applying a simple treatment, or ““fix,” to convert instances of
“standardized authority scores” (i.e., -66, -77, and -88) to conventional polity scores (i.e., within the
range, -10 to +10).
