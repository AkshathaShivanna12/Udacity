    "In this project, we design and analyze an A/B test run by Udacity. The aim of the experiment is to reduce the number of students who desert after the free trial because of unaligned expectations of how much effort the courses demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment has two conditions. After students selected in the main homepage that they wanted to start the free trial, some students were asked how many hours a week they planned committing for the course. For those who said less than 5 hours, they were shown a message saying that generally more than 5 hours for successful completion is needed. They were, then, given the choice to proceed signing up, or to take the free courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectations of the experiment was that when students were given correct information about completion time per week, less students would desert the course after the two weeks of free trial. Therefore, if the experiment is correct, we should observe a difference in the number of dessertions for both groups. We will be more precise with the metrics used in the experiment in the Metrics section.\n",

    "### Unit of diversion\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion will be a cookie. If the student decides to enroll, then they will be tracked by user-id for the rest of the experiment. \n",

    "- Retention\n",
    "- Net conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the invariant metrics. If randomization is correctly done, we should not be observing differences between control and experiment conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Number of cookies* on course overview webpage should not be affected by the randomization. Note that the randomization occurs after a user has landed in the web page and clicks \"start free trial\". Therefore, as this is a pre-experiment metric, there should be no difference between experiment and control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Number of clicks* and *click-through probabilities* should also remain the same. As we mentioned before, the start free trial click is the beginning step for the randomization. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that one group would have on average more clicks than the other. This is also true for the click-probability, given that a condition for randomization is that the user has clicked on that button.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Number of user ids* should definitely be affected by the experiment. If the experiment works, then we should observe that less people in the experimental group will continue to create a Udacity account. The warning message would serve to disuade those students who are not sure about its time commitment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gross-conversion* should also be affected. As we mentioned, the warning for those students who have less than 5 hours should serve as a dissuassive mechanism. Therefore, all things equal, we should oberve less students enrolling for the free-trial. Thus, the gross conversion rate will be lower for this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Retention* should be bigger for the experiment students. If the experiment works, less students who show less commitment should go on to register for the trial period. Therefore, in general there will be less drop-outs from this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Net conversion can be tricky. As the experiment was planned, the only thing that should be affected is the number of users that drop out during the trial period. All things equal, this should not affect how many people will continue registering after the 14 day span. However, we want to make sure that we can observe this from the data. Therefore, we want to check if the experiment introduces a significant decrease in net conversion. \n",

    "The goal of the experiment can be measured at two thresholds. The first is to check if the message actually works. The warning message is there to make people with little time to reflect on its time commitments. Therefore, it should lower the amount of people willing to register after receiving that message. This first effect can be measured with two metrics: number of users ids per condition and gross conversion. In both cases, we would expect lower numbers for the experimental condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the experiment is ultimately interested in reducing dessertion after signing up. This is meassured by retention. The idea here is that the experiment is more forward looking. It is not only interested in the immediate effect of the message, but also what it means in terms of people signing up after the trial period is passed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first threshold would only tell us if the experiment is actually working. However, as retention and net conversion is of interest for the company we think it would only be worth the while making such change if the retention rate is bigger for the experimental group. We would be also very interested in checking if it si true that the net conversion is not significantly reduced. For example, one of the unintentional consequences of the experiment could also be to reduce the number of people who remained enrolled passed the 14 days span. This would be something very worrying that the company might want to avoid. "

We also do not observe significant differences in the sign test. However, a closer look at our graph shows something to be concerned with. Note that the confidence interval of our point estimate does include the lower end of the practical significant. This means that there is a chance that the message is lowering the number of people that decide to go on with the course. This, of course, are not good news, as Udacity does not want to turn away students that would have originally enrolled.\n",

    "The setup would be different from before. The way we want to reach our students is via email. This email would tell, in a positive way, stories of success, of people narrating that they needed to do the extra effort to complete the program, but it was worth it. Then, a link would get them to the last class they were in. Ideally, we would want to send this message sometime during the first week of enrollment.\n",
